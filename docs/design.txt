Problem Statement

A program is needed that will calculate the date a seed should be planted and the 
harverst date if they were to plant on the recommended date based on user input. 
The program will ask the user to input the seed name, days to maturity, last and 
first frost dates for their growing zone, days to plant before first or last frost, 
and the season they are planting in. The user will be able to enter as many seeds 
as they need. The program will then display the indoor plant date and/or outdoor plant date, the 
harvest date, as well as all of the information the user entered so it can be printed.

Nouns: indoor plant date, outdoor plant date, seed name, days to maturity, last frost date, 
first frost date, season, harvest date, days before frost

Verbs: calculate, ask, display


Defining Diagram

INPUTS:
seed name

last frost date
first frost date
season
days before frost

PROCESSING:
prompt for seed name
prompt for days to maturity
prompt for last frost date
prompt for first frost date
prompt for season 
prompt for days before frost
calculate plant date
